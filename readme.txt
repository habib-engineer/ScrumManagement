Make sure that the server path has the right port number in common/common.services
And right origion path for CORS is defined in the RetrospectivesController and FeedbacksController

Technology VS 2013, AngularJs, WebApi, Bootstrap, Autofac, NUnit, Moq

Its a single page application, on client side for Retrospective I am using WebApi to get and put data, to complete the feedback UI I have used some dummy data to show the required screens.

I added some controller unites to prove that I can do unit testing, because of time shortage I couldn't do full unit test.

Also added a test tracwriter to prove that we can add any logger to log our trace.

The solution is running multiple projects, when the screen load its loading data a bit slowly first time.
